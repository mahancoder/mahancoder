# My Projects

Here is a list of projects I've done

## [Unoffician Adobe Connect client for Linux](https://github.com/mahancoder/Adobe-Connect-Linux)
This project is my most starred project, and the only project that feels like an actaul open-source project.  
Essentially, this is a client for meeting hosted by Adobe Connect, which my school used for online classes.  
Since the app doesn't have a Linux version, and I daily drive Linux, I wrote a dummy Linux version for it.  

## [Linux-related stuff](https://github.com/mahancoder/.dotfiles)
This is a collection of configs and scripts for my Linux workflow. I've spent a few months configuring all these apps and I will update this repo regularly, as long as I daily drive Linux.

## Covid Alerter
Covid Alerter is a big project that isn't done yet.  
In a nutshell, it's an app that tracks Covid-infected people and generates some rankings for individual neighbourhoods.  
The rank is calculated based on each neighbourhood's score, which shows how severe Covid is in there.  
The project consists of 3 sub-projects:
* [The Backend API](https://github.com/mahancoder/CovidAlerterBackendApi)
* [The analyzer and score generator script](https://github.com/mahancoder/covid-alerter-data-analyzer)
* [The Android/iOS client](https://github.com/mahancoder/covid-alerter-mobile-app)

## [Sieve toolkit](https://github.com/mahancoder/Sieve-Toolkit)
A toolkit for various functions of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm  
This is a school project, so it's not the best project I've doen. The codebase is messy and I no longer maintain it
