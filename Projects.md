# My Projects

Here is a list of projects I've done

## [Unofficial Adobe Connect client for Linux](https://github.com/mahancoder/Adobe-Connect-Linux)
This project is my most starred project, and the only project that feels like an actaul open-source project.  
Essentially, this is a client for meeting hosted by Adobe Connect, which my school used for online classes.  
Since the app doesn't have a Linux version, and I daily drive Linux, I wrote a dummy Linux version for it.  

## [Linux-related stuff](https://github.com/mahancoder/.dotfiles)
This is a collection of configs and scripts for my Linux workflow. I've spent a few months configuring all these apps and I will update this repo regularly, as long as I daily drive Linux.

## Covid Alerter
Covid Alerter is a big project that isn't done yet.  
In a nutshell, it's an app that tracks Covid-infected people and generates some rankings for individual neighbourhoods.  
The rank is calculated based on each neighbourhood's score, which shows how severe Covid is in there.  
The project consists of 3 sub-projects:
* [The Backend API](https://github.com/mahancoder/CovidAlerterBackendApi)
* [The analyzer and score generator script](https://github.com/mahancoder/covid-alerter-data-analyzer)
* [The Android/iOS client](https://github.com/mahancoder/covid-alerter-mobile-app) (Nothing more than the template for now)

## [Sieve toolkit](https://github.com/mahancoder/Sieve-Toolkit)
A toolkit for various functions of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm  
This is a school project, so it's not the best project I've doen. The codebase is messy and I no longer maintain it

## [Paya Programming Competition](https://github.com/mahancoder/paya-coding-competition)
This one is not really a project, but rather a competition. You can find all the questions and answers in the repo. We also ended up winning the gold medal in the country in 2022.

If you want more info about any of these projects, visit their readme.
